description: End-to-end model optimization pipeline that chains quantization with deployment or evaluation. Use when user says "optimize model end-to-end", "quantize and deploy", "quantize and serve", "quantize and evaluate", "quantize and benchmark accuracy", "full optimization loop", "run the full pipeline", "optimize and test accuracy", "find best quantization recipe", or wants to go from a pretrained model to a deployed or accuracy-verified quantized model. Do NOT use for individual tasks like only quantizing (use ptq), only deploying (use deployment), or only evaluating (use evaluation).

# ModelOpt Optimizer — Pipeline Orchestrator

Orchestrates optimization pipelines by chaining skills. Supports two modes:

1. **PTQ + Deploy** — quantize then serve as an API endpoint
2. **PTQ + Evaluate** — quantize then benchmark accuracy (evaluation handles deployment internally)

This skill delegates to sub-skills. **Do not duplicate their logic — invoke them.**

## Workspace Management

If `MODELOPT_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set (multi-user / Slack bot), read `skills/common/workspace-management.md` first. **All sub-skills in the pipeline must run in the same workspace** so they share the checkpoint and any code modifications. Create or reuse a workspace named after the model (e.g., `qwen3-0.6b`, `llama-3.1-8b-fp8`) before invoking any sub-skill.

## Pipeline Selection

Determine which pipeline the user needs:

| User says | Pipeline |
|-----------|----------|
| "quantize and deploy", "quantize and serve" | PTQ + Deploy |
| "quantize and evaluate", "optimize end-to-end", "find best recipe" | PTQ + Evaluate |

If the user only wants quantization without deploy/eval, the `ptq` skill handles it directly — this skill should not be used.

If unclear, ask: **"After quantization, do you want to (a) deploy the model as a server, (b) evaluate accuracy, or (c) just get the checkpoint?"** If they answer (c), hand off to the `ptq` skill.

## Step 1: Gather Info

Collect from the user (skip what's already provided):

1. **Model path** — local path or HuggingFace model ID
2. **Quantization format** — e.g., fp8, nvfp4, int4_awq (or "recommend one")
3. **GPU IDs** — which GPUs to use (default: `0`)
4. For Deploy pipeline: **Deployment framework** — vLLM, SGLang, or TRT-LLM (default: vLLM)
5. For Evaluate pipeline: **Evaluation tasks** — default: `mmlu`

## Step 2: Quantize

**Invoke the `ptq` skill.** It handles environment detection, model compatibility, format selection, job submission, and checkpoint verification.

Input: model path, quantization format, export path, GPU IDs.
Output: quantized checkpoint at export path.

## Step 3: Deploy or Evaluate

### PTQ + Deploy

**Invoke the `deployment` skill.** It starts an inference server with the quantized checkpoint.

Input: checkpoint path, framework, GPU IDs, port.
Output: running server at `http://localhost:<port>`.

### PTQ + Evaluate

**Invoke the `evaluation` skill.** It handles deploying the quantized model, configuring NEL evaluation, running benchmarks, and collecting results.

Input: quantized checkpoint path, evaluation tasks.
Output: accuracy scores per task.

## Step 4: Present Results and Iterate

Show results and ask: **"Are you satisfied with these results?"**

- **Yes** — Done. Report final model path and summary.
- **No** — Propose a different recipe (lighter or heavier), loop to Step 2.
- **Quit** — Report partial results. Clean up any running servers.
